gnocl is a GTK+ / Gnome extension for the programming language Tcl,
loosely modeled after the Tk package.  It provides easy to use
commands to build quickly GTK+ / Gnome compliant applications
including canvas widget, GConf and drag and drop. It consists of
several libraries: one for GTK+ widgets, one for the Gnome canvas
widget and one for the GConf database.

"make" compiles all libraries. With "make gnocl", "make canvas"
and "make gconf" only these libraries are build.

This release is tested with GTK+ version 2.2.4, gnome version 2.4.0
and Tcl version 8.4.6 under Linux.

Please see there for newer versions.

License is BSD type which basically means that you can use and modify
the software and sources in open or closed-source projects without
royalities as long as the copyright notices remain unchanged.  See the
file license.terms for details.

To start:
   - cd src; make 
   - as superuser: make install 
     (makes a new directory in the tcl libary directory and copies the
      gnocl libaries into it. If another directory than the standard 
      tcl directory should be used, use 
      "make DESTDIR=/special/directory install")
   - (as normal user) 
      cd ../demos/; ./doTests 
      or
      cd ../demos/; for el in test-*.tcl; do ./$el; done

If you have problems, please first run gtk-demo to test if GTK+ realy
works. If you have still problems please mail with a full error
description.

----------------------------- FAQ -------------------------------------

1) Q: Does gnocl work with MS Windows?
   A: Since Gtk as well as Tcl work with MS Windows, gnocl should work,
      too. But until now, nobody stepped in to try it out and send me
      a success report. If you want to try it, or are willing to 
      sponsor the development, I'll give you all the support I can.

2) Q: Why is feature XXX not implemented?
   A: Gnocl is still under active developement. By writing a feature 
      request by email it is however possible to influence the priority 
      in which features are implemented.
